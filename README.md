# Cubik_Game
VR shape-matching game for cognitive and motor skill development in disabled users.

## Project Overview
**Cubik Game** is a purpose-built virtual reality (VR) application designed to enhance **cognitive function, fine motor skills, and spatial awareness** for individuals with mental disabilities. Developed for the **Meta Quest 2** platform, the application provides a calming, distraction-free environment where users engage in a foundational shape-matching task.

The core design principle is guided, positive reinforcement to ensure a non-frustrating and effective learning experience. By using physical interaction via the Quest controllers, the game helps bridge the gap between virtual task execution and real-world motor skill development.

## Target Audience & Goals
- **Target Users**: Individuals with mental or cognitive disabilities who benefit from structured, repetitive, and guided exercises.

- **Cognitive Goals**: Improve shape recognition, attention span, and the ability to follow sequential instructions.

- **Motor Goals**: Develop hand-eye coordination, grip control, and crossing the midline (due to shape generation on both left and right sides).

## Key Features
1. **Infinite Guided Gameplay**: The game features continuous, self-paced play that cycles through 6 distinct geometric shapes. There are no levels to fail or a session to end, allowing for extended practice.

2. **Seated, Accessible Design**: All interaction zones (board, shape generators, display) are placed within easy, comfortable reach for a patient seated on a chair, prioritizing accessibility and minimizing physical fatigue.

3. **Real-Time Instructional Display**: A dedicated display screen directly in front of the user provides clear, step-by-step text instructions for every phase of the task.

4. **Error Correction & Progressive Hinting**: If a shape is placed incorrectly, the system provides immediate, gentle instructions and visual cues (e.g., highlighting the correct slot) to guide the user without causing frustration.

5. **Positive Reinforcement**: Successful placement is immediately followed by a congratulatory message and the activation of the next randomized task, reinforcing positive actions.

6. **Alternating Hand Use**: Shapes are randomly generated on the left and right sides of the table, requiring the user to alternate reach and promoting bilateral coordination.

## How It Works
The game sequence follows a simple, repetitive loop:

1. **Initial Prompt**: The display instructs the user to look at the right-side generator.

2. **Shape Generation** (Right): A random geometric shape appears on the right generation spot.

3. **Matching Task**: The user uses the hand controller to pick up the shape and attempt to place it into the corresponding cutout on the central board.

4. **Feedback Loop**:

    - **Success**: A congratulatory message appears. A new, randomly chosen shape is generated on the left side, restarting the loop.

    - **Failure**: The display gives corrective instructions, and the correct slot may flash until the shape is successfully placed.

5. **Alternation**: After a successful left-side placement, the game cycles back to generating a shape on the right, ensuring even practice across both hands.
